# Adapter Pattern Converter Example

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leandrocgsi/adapter-pattern-converter-example.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/leandrocgsi/adapter-pattern-converter-example)

This my playground with Design Pattern Adapter. This code was built based on [Design Patterns - Adapter Pattern](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/adapter_pattern.htm) post and my another Repo about [GSON and Jackson](https://github.com/leandrocgsi/GSONJacksonPlayground).
